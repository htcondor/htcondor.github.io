  It is possible to update a class ad in the collector, such that the contents
  of the class ad can cause a buffer in the condor_negotiator to overflow.
  This can result in a crash, or potentially a root compromise of the
  condor_negotiator.  This compromise requires the user to be able to use the
  condor_advertise command.  This is the case for ordinary users, if host-based
  authorization is used on machines running Condor daemons, which includes all
  submission and execution hosts.

  This vulnerability requires local access on a machine that is able to use the
  condor_advertise command to change a class ad.  If host-based authorization
  is used this will be at least those hosts that run a Condor daemon.

  If the user can use the condor_advertise command, the effort is fairly low to
  create a denial of service attack, by crashing the negotiator, while gaining
  root access requires the ability to run arbitrary code through stack smashing
  techniques.  If a stronger form of authentication and authorization is used,
  then ordinary users cannot run condor_advertise, and the vulnerability is
  mitigated.

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an escalation
  of privilege to the account used to run the condor_negotiator on the central
  manager host.  If the negotiator is running as root, which is not required in
  all configurations, then a root compromise is possible.

<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  There were two potential buffer overflows in the function
  Accountant::GetResourceName in the file Accountant.C.  The function looks up
  the Name and StartdIpAddr in the startd class ad.  These values were placed
  in two 64 byte buffers.  Since the user can control the values of these two
  attributes by calling condor_advertise, they can set a value that overflows
  the storage.  The storage for these two values is on the stack, so a stack
  smashing attack could be attempted, which could result in an escalation of
  privilege to root, or a denial of service (crash).
<p>  The condor_advertise command requires the user to have DAEMON access
  privilege.  If host-based authorization is used then any host with a Condor
  daemon will have this privilege.  This means that any user on such a host
  will be able to use the condor_advertise command.  They can use the
  condor_advertise to update startd ads to contain attributes "StartdIpAddr,"
  or "Name" to have a value of greater than 64 bytes.

    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The cause of this is the use of a fixed sized buffer, where the value to be
  placed in the buffer is blindly copied into the buffer without first checking
  the size of the value.

  Use a string class that resizes itself automatically and prevents buffer
  overflows.
<p>  Use a more strict authentication and authorization than host-based
  authorization, so only daemons and administrators can update class ads in the
  collector.
