  In the rare configuration that CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY is set in the Condor
  configuration, arbitrary executables can be executed with the permissions of
  the condor_negotiator and condor_shadow's effective uid (normally the
  "condor" user).  This can result in a compromise of the condor configuration
  files, log files, and other files owned by the "condor" user.  This may also
  aid in attacks on other accounts.

  To exploit this vulnerability requires only the submission of a Condor job
  with an invalid entry, and the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY to be configured.
  Normally, CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY is not defined, preventing this
  vulnerability.

  Usually, the condor_negotiator and condor_startd are configured to run as the
  "condor" user, and this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
  arbitrary executables as the "condor" user.
<p>  Since log files and other data files are owned by the "condor" user, they can
  be arbitrarily modified.  Also, if the condor_negotiator is started as condor,
  the condor_negotiator can be attacked and the condor_negotiator is central to
  the operation of a Condor system.
<p>  Depending on the configuration, further more serious attacks may be possible.
  If the configuration files of the Condor system are writable by condor and
  the condor_master is run with root privileges, then root access can be
  gained.  If the condor binaries are owned by the "condor" user, these
  executables could be replaced, and when restarted, arbitrary code could be
  executed as the "condor" user. This also would allow root access as most Condor
  daemons are started with an effective uid of root.

  The classad mechanism allows a site to configure a directory of external
  scripts using the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY variable.  If this is set, then
  expressions containing terms of the following form <code>script("arg0",
  "arg1", "argN")</code>, will end up making a call to popen, using the first
  argument combined with the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY value to form the name
  of a script and the remaining arguments are passed to the script with strings
  surrounded by double quotes.
<p>  Since the full path of the script to be executed is the concatenation of
  the value of CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY, a '/' and the script name (first
  argument to the script function), the script to execute can be outside of the
  CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY if the script name contains parent directory
  components.
<p>  For instance, if you wanted to execute <code>/usr/bin/xterm -display
  example.com:0.0</code>, and the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY were set to
  /home/condor/scripts, then the following term in a classad would accomplish
  the goal:
<p>	<code>script("../../../usr/bin/xterm" "-display"
	"example.com:0.0")</code>

  Only allow the script name to be a simple filename.  Do not allow a directory
  separator to appear in the script name, or if you do wish to allow subdirectories
  in the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY, then the filtering could be done on parent
  directory entries in the path.
